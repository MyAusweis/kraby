## Overview

Kraby is an **open-source**, **3d-printable** hexapod robot that is geared towards
building a solid development platform for research and educational purpose.

The robot was designed during a Master 1
project at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/), France.

### Easy to remix

The robot was designed using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/),
a free and open-source 3D computer graphics editing software.

### Smart servo-motors

Kraby uses 18 **Herkulex DRS-0101** servomotors from Dongbu to stay cost
effective while offering reasonable performances.
These includes a DC motor, a gear reducer, a control circuitry and
serial communications capability.
These servomotors are able to measure motor torque and speed, and are easy to
use with a serial port.

These servomotors are similar to the more popular **Dynamixel AX-12**.

### Simulation environment included

An [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment is available.
It uses [BulletPhysics](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) simulator
with [an URDF description](https://github.com/erdnaxe/kraby/blob/master/urdf_description/hexapod.urdf) of the robot.
